# AeraSync

AeraSync is a mobile and web application designed to streamline the calculation and tracking of the Standard Oxygen Transfer Rate (SOTR) and Standard Aeration Efficiency (SAE) for aerators in aquaculture ponds. The app provides a seamless interface for technicians to perform daily checkpointing, ensuring accurate and efficient monitoring of aeration performance. Future versions will incorporate AI-driven predictions to optimize aeration efficiency.

AeraSync is built using Dart and Flutter, enabling cross-platform support for mobile (Android, iOS) and web. The web version is hosted on GitHub Pages at [https://luisvinatea.github.io/AeraSync/](https://luisvinatea.github.io/AeraSync/).

## Features

- **SOTR & SAE Calculation** – Compute key aerator efficiency metrics effortlessly using a built-in calculator.
- **Aerator Comparison** – Compare two aerators based on SOTR, cost, and maintenance to determine the most cost-effective option.
- **Oxygen Demand and Estimation** – Calculate oxygen demand and estimate the number of aerators needed, with both farm-based and experimental methods.
- **Cross-Platform Support** – Available on Android, iOS, and web, with a consistent user experience.
- **User-Friendly Interface** – Designed for field technicians with a simple and intuitive UI.
- **Localization** – Supports multiple languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese) for broader accessibility.
- **Data Integration** – Includes preloaded datasets (e.g., `o2_temp_sal_100_sat.json`) for accurate calculations.
- **Interactive Charts** – Visualize key metrics using interactive charts powered by `fl_chart`.
- **Predictive Analytics (Upcoming)** – AI-driven insights for aeration optimization (planned for future releases).

## Installation

AeraSync is a Flutter project. Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/luisvinatea/AeraSync.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```sh
   cd AeraSync
   ```
3. **Install Flutter Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Flutter installed (see [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)). Then, install the project dependencies:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. **Run the Application**:
   - Using the Makefile:
     ```sh
     make run-flutter
     ```
   - Or directly:
     ```sh
     flutter run -d chrome
     ```
   - For mobile (Android/iOS emulator or device):
     ```sh
     flutter run
     ```

## Development Tasks

- **Generate Localization Files**:
  After updating the `.arb` files in `lib/l10n/`, regenerate the localization classes:
  ```sh
  make gen-l10n
  ```
  Or:
  ```sh
  flutter gen-l10n
  ```

- **Run Tests**:
  Run the unit and widget tests:
  ```sh
  make test
  ```
  Or:
  ```sh
  flutter test
  ```

- **Build for Web**:
  Create a release build for web deployment:
  ```sh
  make build-web
  ```
  Or:
  ```sh
  flutter build web --release
  ```

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

The web version of AeraSync is hosted on GitHub Pages. To deploy an updated version:

1. Build the web app with the correct base href (since the app is hosted at `/AeraSync/`):
   ```sh
   flutter build web --release --base-href=/AeraSync/
   ```
2. Copy the build output to the `gh-pages` branch (using a worktree or direct checkout):
   ```sh
   git worktree add ../AeraSync-gh-pages gh-pages
   cp -r build/web/* ../AeraSync-gh-pages/
   cd ../AeraSync-gh-pages
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update web deployment"
   git push origin gh-pages
   ```
3. Visit [https://luisvinatea.github.io/AeraSync/](https://luisvinatea.github.io/AeraSync/) to see the updated site.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend & Cross-Platform**: Dart / Flutter
- **Backend (Future)**: Python (e.g., `sotr_calculator.py` for calculations, potential integration with Flask or Firebase)
- **Data Storage**: Local JSON files (e.g., `o2_temp_sal_100_sat.json`); future plans for cloud storage (Firestore/PostgreSQL)
- **Web Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **AI Engine (Future)**: TensorFlow.js or PyTorch for predictive analytics

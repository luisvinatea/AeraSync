      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to AeraSync, a tool for comparing aerators in shrimp farming
        through a step-by-step survey. This Privacy Policy explains how we
        collect, use, and protect your data when you use our application. We are
        committed to handling your information responsibly.
      </p>

      <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        When you use AeraSync and agree to data collection (via the optional
        disclosure dialog), we may collect anonymous, non-personally
        identifiable data, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Survey Inputs:</strong> Values you enter, such as farm area,
          water temperature, salinity, pond depth, shrimp biomass, aerator
          specifications (e.g., horsepower, price), and financial parameters
          (e.g., electricity cost, discount rate).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Calculated Results:</strong> Metrics generated from your
          inputs, such as the number of aerators needed or cost comparisons.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> collect personal information like your name,
        email, IP address, or location. All data is anonymized and cannot be
        linked to you.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
      <p>
        We use the collected data solely for research to improve AeraSync.
        Anonymized and aggregated data helps us:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand usage patterns and common survey inputs.</li>
        <li>Enhance the accuracy and functionality of the tool.</li>
        <li>Optimize aerator comparison models for shrimp farming.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not share, sell, or distribute your data to third parties for any
        purpose.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>
        Data is stored securely using industry-standard measures to protect
        against unauthorized access or loss. As the data is anonymous, it is not
        linked to any individual. However, no system is completely secure, and
        we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Choices</h2>
      <p>
        Data collection is optional. You can use AeraSync without agreeing to
        data collection by declining the disclosure dialog (if shown). Your
        results will still be displayed locally. If you agree, you can withdraw
        consent by resetting the app’s preferences, though previously collected
        anonymous data may remain in aggregated datasets.
      </p>

      <h2>Legal Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        We comply with applicable data protection laws. As our data is
        anonymous, most privacy rights (e.g., data access, deletion) may not
        apply, but we strive to maintain transparency and security.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal
        requirements. Updates will be posted here, with the “Last Updated” date
        revised. Please review periodically.

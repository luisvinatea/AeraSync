    <h1>AeraSync Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: April 12, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to AeraSync, a tool designed to calculate aerator performance and estimate the number of aerators for shrimp ponds. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use our application. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to handling your information responsibly.</p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you use AeraSync and opt-in to data collection by checking the consent box, we may collect the following anonymous or non-personally identifiable information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Input Data:</strong> Values you enter into the calculator, such as temperature, salinity, horsepower, volume, T10, T70, electricity cost, aerator brand (if provided), and type.</li>
      <li><strong>Calculated Results:</strong> Metrics generated by the calculator based on your inputs (e.g., SOTR, SAE, number of aerators, costs).</li>
      <li><strong>Consent Status:</strong> Confirmation that you agreed to data collection for research purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect directly identifying personal information like your name, email address, IP address, or precise location. While you can optionally enter an aerator brand name, this information is collected solely as part of the technical input data for research and is not used to identify you.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>The collected input data and calculated results are used solely for research purposes to improve AeraSync and understand aerator performance trends in aquaculture. Specifically, the aggregated and anonymized data helps us:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Analyze trends in calculator usage and common parameter values.</li>
      <li>Identify areas for improvement in the calculation models.</li>
      <li>Enhance the accuracy, features, and functionality of the tool for all users.</li>
      <li>Potentially contribute to anonymized research publications or reports on aquaculture aeration efficiency.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, share, or distribute your specific input data or results to third parties for marketing or any purpose other than the research described above.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Data collected with consent is stored securely using reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures designed to protect it from unauthorized access, disclosure, loss, or misuse. Data is stored in a way that is not directly linked to any individual user. However, please be aware that no internet transmission or electronic storage system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices and Consent</h2>
    <p>Data collection is enirrely optional. You can fully use AeraSync without consenting to data collection by leaving the consent checkbox unchecked. Your calculation results will still be displayed locally within the app.</p>
    <p>If you initially consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent for future data collection at any time by unchecking the consent box within the application. Please note that data collected prior to your withdrawal may remain part of our aggregated, anonymized research datasets.</p>

    <h2>Legal Compliance</h2>
    <p>We strive to comply with applicable data protection laws, including principles found in regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Brazil's Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD), where relevant. If you are in a region with specific privacy rights, you may have rights regarding your data, such as access or correction, although the anonymous nature of the collected data may limit the applicability of certain rights.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:aerasync@icloud.com">aerasync@icloud.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the "Last Updated" date at the top will be revised. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
